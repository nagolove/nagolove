This information is unstructured. May be later I will rewrite it.

I'm currently working on some projects:
  * [Genetic game](https://github.com/nagolove/automato)
  * [Nback](https://github.com/nagolove/nback2) - mobile game for training memory and fluid intelligence
  * T-80(temporally named T-90) - closed source.
 
 All stuff written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and base on ([Love2D](https://love2d.org/)) framework. 
 Also I use a typed Lua dialect called [Teal](https://github.com/teal-language/tl). It is just fun transpiler for type annotation of source code for such dynamic language as Lua is.

C++ is like a shit. Rust is crab power!
