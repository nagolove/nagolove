This information is unstructured. May be later I will rewrite it.

I'm currently working on some projects(in priority order):
  * *frozen* [T-80](https://nagolove.github.io/t80) - topdown action/RPG with military vehicles. Written on pure C with [RayLib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) help, built-in Lua engine.
  * *frozen* [Genetic game](https://github.com/nagolove/automato) - genetic algorithm game prototype
  * *frozen* [Nback](https://github.com/nagolove/nback2) - mobile game for training memory and fluid intelligence  
  * *frozen* [2048+](https://nagolove.github.io/2048) classic 2048 game plus some additions
  * [puzzle](https://nagolove.github.io/pzl) classic 15 puzzle game
  
 Also I use a typed Lua dialect called [Teal](https://github.com/teal-language/tl). It is just fun transpiler for type annotation of source code for such dynamic language as Lua is.

âœ¨ Online coding **[stream](https://www.twitch.tv/228hooligan)** on twitch âœ¨

ðŸ”­ I am interested in JIT compilation programming and learning neural network basics.
