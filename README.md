### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--

This information is unstructured. May be later I will rewrite it.

I'm currently working on some projects(in priority order):
  * T-80 - topdown action/RPG with military vehicles. Written on pure C with [RayLib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) help, built-in Lua engine.
  * [Genetic game](https://github.com/nagolove/automato) - genetic algorithm game prototype
  * [Nback](https://github.com/nagolove/nback2) - mobile game for training memory and fluid intelligence  
 
 âš¡ Some stuff written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and based on ([Love2D](https://love2d.org/)) framework. 
 Also I use a typed Lua dialect called [Teal](https://github.com/teal-language/tl). It is just fun transpiler for type annotation of source code for such dynamic language as Lua is.

âœ¨ Online coding **[stream](https://www.twitch.tv/228hooligan)** on twitch âœ¨

ðŸ”­ I am interested in JIT compilation programming and learning neural network basics.
